//Suppose you are given an array, A, containing 100 integers that

// object of type java.util.Random. Let x denote the product
// of the integers in A. There is a single number that x will
// equal with probability at least 0.99. What is that number and
//what is a formula describing the probability that x is equal
// to that number?
//    the number for which x will equal with a probability
//    at least 0.99 is 0, and the formula describing the
//    probability that x is equal to 0 is:
//
//
//    1 - (0.9)^100â‰ˆ 0.99997
