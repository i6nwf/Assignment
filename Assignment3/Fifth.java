// What is the difference between a shallow equality test and a
// deep equality test between two Java arrays,
// A and B, if they are one-dimensional arrays of type int?
// What if the arrays are two-dimensional arrays of type int?

// Shallow Equality Test:
//- When we perform a shallow equality test on arrays A and B, we're comparing whether A and B reference the same array object in memory. In other words, we're checking whether A and B point to the exact same array instance.
//
//Deep Equality Test:
//- Conversely, with a deep equality test, we're examining the actual contents of the arrays. For one-dimensional arrays, elements at each index are compared to see if they are equal.
//
//One-Dimensional Arrays:
//- For one-dimensional arrays, the shallow equality test compares whether the two array variables point to the same memory location.
//  - Shallow equality test example:
//    java
//    int[] A = {1, 2, 3};
//    int[] B = A;  // B points to the same array as A
//    boolean shallowEqual = (A == B);  // This will be true
//
//
//- Conversely, a deep equality test for one-dimensional arrays would compare the individual elements within the arrays to determine if they are equal.
//  - Deep equality test example:
//    java
//    int[] A = {1, 2, 3};
//    int[] B = {1, 2, 3};  // Same elements, but different memory locations
//    boolean deepEqual = Arrays.equals(A, B);  // This will be true
//
//
//Two-Dimensional Arrays:
//- When it comes to two-dimensional arrays, the same principles apply. Shallow equality checks whether the variables reference the same array object in memory, while deep equality tests the contents of the arrays, including the elements within the arrays themselves.
//  - Shallow and deep equality test examples for two-dimensional arrays follow the same principles as for one-dimensional arrays, but the comparison considers the contents of the entire multidimensional array.
//
//It's important to remember that for deep equality testing,
// especially with multidimensional arrays, deep comparison of
// every element is crucial. In such scenarios, tools like the Arrays.
// deepEquals() method should be used to accurately compare multidimensional
// arrays for equality.
