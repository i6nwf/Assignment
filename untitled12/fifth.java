//   2.9  What are some potential efficiency disadvantages of having very deep inheritance trees,
//    that is, a large set of classes, A, B, C, and so on, such that B extends A, C extends B, D extends C, etc.?
//    1. Compilation Time and Complexity: With a deep inheritance tree, the compilation time could increase significantly.
//    It can become more time-consuming and complex for the compiler to resolve and verify the inheritance and associated
//    dependencies of classes.
//
//2. Runtime Performance: Deep inheritance hierarchies can lead to performance overhead. Method invocation
// and data access in deeply nested subclasses might require additional runtime lookups, possibly impacting performance.
//
//3. Maintenance and Refactoring Challenges: As the number of classes increases in the hierarchy,
// maintaining and refactoring the code becomes more challenging.
// Renaming or modifying base classes might require cascading changes across multiple subclasses,
// increasing the likelihood of errors and making updates more time-consuming.
//
//4. Increase in Memory Usage: Each subclass instance might contain member variables inherited from its parent classes,
// leading to a potential increase in memory usage. Deep inheritance trees may result in instances with a larger memory
// footprint due to the accumulation of member variables from multiple levels of inheritance.
//
//5. Complexity in Code Navigation: A large hierarchy can make it more challenging for developers
// to understand and navigate the codebase. Understanding the relationships between classes, their behavior,
// and the potential impact of changes becomes increasingly complex.
//
//6. Risk of Tight Coupling: Deep inheritance hierarchies can lead to increased coupling between classes,
// making it more difficult to isolate and modify individual classes without impacting many others.
// Tight coupling can reduce code flexibility and reusability.
//
//7. Potential for Fragility: Long inheritance chains can make the code more fragile, especially in
// scenarios where changes at one level of the hierarchy inadvertently affect other classes downstream.
// Such unintended interactions can introduce hidden bugs and unexpected behavior, making the system more fragile.
